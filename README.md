# Set Seed in RSG Mod
A mod to make every new Minecraft world a set seed. Random seeds become a set seed. It makes set seed minecraft speedruns look like a RSG run. 

## Installation

Download and install the [fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

Put [this mod `.jar`](https://github.com/55c3/set-seed-rsg/releases) file into your minecraft mods folder.

Remember to remove this mod before doing any official Random Seed speedrun. This is purely for education.

*DO NOT SUBMIT ANY RUN THAT USED THIS MOD TO THE RSG LEADERBOARD*

## Usage

Every new Minecraft world will be a set seed when no seed is entered on the create world screen. The seed will be `2195521955`, but you can change it by editing the `Mod.java` file and building the mod from source.

## Build from Source
- clone the [repository](https://github.com/55c3/set-seed-rsg.git)
